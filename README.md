    *   **How to use it:** Choose a layout (Grid, Vertical, Horizontal), tap to add your photos, and save or share your creation instantly.

2.  **üì∏ Image Compressor**
    *   **What it does:** Shrink the size of your photos without losing much quality. Perfect for saving storage or sending images faster on messaging apps.
    *   **How to use it:** Select a photo, use the slider to choose your preferred quality level (lower quality = smaller size), and save the new lighter version.

3.  **üîä Text to Listen**
    *   **What it does:** Type any text and the app will read it out loud to you. Great for listening to notes, practicing pronunciation, or just giving your eyes a rest.

4.  **üí° More Brightness**
    *   **What it does:** Quickly make your screen brighter than the system maximum. Ideal for when you're outside in the sun and need extra visibility.
